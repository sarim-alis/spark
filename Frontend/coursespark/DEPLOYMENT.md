# CourseSpark Deployment Options

## Current Status
✅ **Base44 Authentication is NOW ENABLED**
- Run `npm run dev` and you'll get real login
- Works with Base44's hosted database and AI services
- Can deploy to Vercel/Netlify immediately

## Option 1: Keep Base44 (Current Setup) ✅ ACTIVE

**Pros:**
- ✅ Authentication handled (OAuth, magic links, etc.)
- ✅ Database hosted (PostgreSQL via Supabase)
- ✅ AI integrations ready (OpenAI via Base44)
- ✅ Payment processing (Stripe integration)
- ✅ Fast to deploy

**Cons:**
- ❌ Depends on Base44 service
- ❌ Limited to their infrastructure

**Deploy:**
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy dist/ to Vercel, Netlify, etc.
```

## Option 2: Remove Base44 (Self-Hosted)

To deploy anywhere without Base44, you need to replace:

### 1. **Authentication** 
Replace with:
- Supabase Auth (free tier)
- Firebase Auth
- Auth0
- NextAuth.js
- Custom JWT auth

### 2. **Database**
Replace with:
- Supabase (PostgreSQL - free tier)
- Firebase Firestore
- MongoDB Atlas
- Your own PostgreSQL/MySQL

### 3. **AI Features**
Replace `InvokeLLM` with:
- Direct OpenAI API calls
- Anthropic Claude API
- Google Gemini API
- Ollama (local LLM)

### 4. **Payment Processing**
Replace with:
- Direct Stripe integration (stripe npm package)
- Paddle
- LemonSqueezy

### 5. **File Storage**
Replace with:
- Supabase Storage
- AWS S3
- Cloudinary
- UploadThing

## Quick Start (Current Setup - Base44 Enabled)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5180 - you'll see Base44 login screen

## Want to Go Self-Hosted?

I can help you migrate to:
1. **Supabase** (auth + database + storage) - Free tier available
2. **OpenAI** (direct API for AI features)
3. **Stripe** (direct integration for payments)

This gives you full control and lets you deploy anywhere (Vercel, Railway, Render, etc.)

**Estimated effort:** 2-4 hours to migrate all features

Let me know which path you prefer!
