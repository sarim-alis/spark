**Title:** Understanding the core architecture and how Ruby on Rails manages the MVC pattern in web applications

**Body:**
```
Ruby on Rails follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern, which separates application logic into three interconnected components. This separation makes code more maintainable, testable, and scalable. The framework handles routing, database interactions, and view rendering automatically, allowing developers to focus on business logic. Understanding this architecture is fundamental to building robust Rails applications.
```

### ðŸ“„ SLIDE 2
**Title:** Setting up a development environment and creating your first Rails application with scaffolding

**Body:**
```
The Rails CLI provides a complete development setup with built-in server, database migrations, and testing framework. You'll learn to install Ruby, Rails, and configure your development environment properly. Rails scaffolding generates a complete CRUD interface in seconds, allowing you to prototype applications quickly. This hands-on approach helps you understand the Rails workflow and file structure from the start.
