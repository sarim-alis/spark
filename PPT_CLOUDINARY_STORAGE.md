# PowerPoint Storage in Cloudinary - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The PowerPoint generation feature now automatically uploads generated PPT files to Cloudinary and stores the URL in the database. This allows users to access their course presentations anytime from the cloud.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Changes**

#### Migration: `2025_01_28_000001_add_powerpoint_to_course.php`
- Added `powerpoint` column to `course` table
- Type: `string(2048)` - stores Cloudinary URL
- Nullable: Yes
- Position: After `thumbnail_url`

#### Course Model Update
- Added `powerpoint` to `$fillable` array
- Allows mass assignment of PowerPoint URLs

### 2. **Backend API**

#### New Controller Method: `CourseController::uploadPowerPoint()`
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/courses/{course}/upload-powerpoint`

**Features:**
- Validates user ownership of course
- Accepts `.ppt` and `.pptx` files (max 50MB)
- Uploads to Cloudinary in `courses/powerpoints` folder
- Uses `resource_type: 'raw'` for non-image files
- Stores secure URL in database
- Returns updated course data

**Request:**
```http
POST /api/courses/{courseId}/upload-powerpoint
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer {token}

powerpoint: [file]
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "PowerPoint uploaded successfully",
  "data": {
    "powerpoint_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
    "course": { ... }
  }
}
```

### 3. **Frontend Changes**

#### Updated `pptGenerator.js`
- Changed from auto-download to returning blob
- Returns `{ success, fileName, blob, message }`
- Blob can be used for both download and upload

#### Updated `courseApi.js`
- Added `uploadPowerPoint(id, file)` method
- Handles FormData creation
- Sets proper headers for file upload

#### Updated `CourseCreator.jsx`
**Two PPT Generation Modes:**

1. **Download Only** (Manual button click)
   - User clicks "Download PPT" button
   - Generates PPT with AI
   - Downloads to user's computer
   - Does NOT upload to Cloudinary

2. **Save & Upload** (When saving course)
   - User clicks "Save Course" button
   - Course is saved to database
   - PPT is automatically generated
   - PPT is uploaded to Cloudinary
   - URL is stored in database
   - User gets success message

## User Flow

### Creating a Course with PPT

```
1. User generates course with AI
   â†“
2. Course preview is displayed
   â†“
3. User can:
   a) Download PPT (manual) â†’ Downloads to computer only
   b) Save Course â†’ Saves course + uploads PPT to Cloudinary
   â†“
4. When saving:
   - Course data saved âœ“
   - PPT generated with AI âœ“
   - PPT uploaded to Cloudinary âœ“
   - URL stored in database âœ“
   â†“
5. User navigated to "My Courses"
```

## Technical Details

### Cloudinary Configuration

**Folder Structure:**
```
courses/
  â”œâ”€â”€ [course thumbnails]
  â””â”€â”€ powerpoints/
      â”œâ”€â”€ course_1_1234567890.pptx
      â”œâ”€â”€ course_2_1234567891.pptx
      â””â”€â”€ ...
```

**File Naming:**
- Format: `course_{courseId}_{timestamp}.pptx`
- Example: `course_42_1738012800.pptx`

**Upload Settings:**
```javascript
{
  folder: 'courses/powerpoints',
  resource_type: 'raw',  // For non-image files
  public_id: 'course_' + courseId + '_' + timestamp
}
```

### Database Schema

**course table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE course (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  thumbnail_url VARCHAR(2048),
  powerpoint VARCHAR(2048),  -- NEW COLUMN
  -- ... other fields
);
```

## API Endpoints

### Upload PowerPoint
```
POST /api/courses/{course}/upload-powerpoint
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body:
  powerpoint: [file] (required, .ppt or .pptx, max 50MB)

Response:
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "PowerPoint uploaded successfully",
    "data": {
      "powerpoint_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
      "course": { ... }
    }
  }
```

### Get Course (includes PowerPoint URL)
```
GET /api/courses/{course}
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Response:
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Course Title",
      "powerpoint": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
      // ... other fields
    }
  }
```

## Error Handling

### Backend Errors

1. **Unauthorized Access**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Unauthorized to modify this course"
}
```

2. **Invalid File Type**
```json
{
  "errors": {
    "powerpoint": ["The powerpoint must be a file of type: pptx, ppt."]
  }
}
```

3. **File Too Large**
```json
{
  "errors": {
    "powerpoint": ["The powerpoint must not be greater than 51200 kilobytes."]
  }
}
```

4. **Cloudinary Upload Failed**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Failed to upload PowerPoint: [error details]"
}
```

### Frontend Error Handling

The frontend gracefully handles errors:
- Course saves successfully even if PPT upload fails
- User sees warning: "Course saved, but PPT upload failed"
- User can manually download PPT using the button
